# Introduction

Hello and welcome to the Worker Feedback Club REST API! See below for a detailed explanation of all the available
endpoints.

This API shows examples using js and axios (mainly because that's what we use).

If something isn't quite working the way you'd expect it to, or this documentation is missing sufficient clarity please
email james@subtap.co.uk. Thank you!
